# Cozmo-World
In the experience, Cozmo is a pizza delivery boy in a city made with cardboard props. The city has fun things for Cozmo like an arcade, merry-go-round and an ice-cream parlour, but unfortunately all of that cost money. He earns money by delivering pizza around the city and receiving tips. There are a lot of game elements in the experience, like risk vs reward — Cozmo can deliver pizzas as soon as they are ready or he can wait a little bit more to get one more pizza in order to optimize for time. Although, waiting might lead to the first pizza becoming too cold when delivered, which has an effect on the amount of tip he gets. Cozmo is able to do all of this on his own (0-player), but he is quite slow and inefficient and would often try to catch your attention by throwing a tantrum. You can control Cozmo using a tablet-based remote control (1-player) and make him more efficient and take him to fun places around the city. This can also be played as a competitive multiplayer game where the player to collect most tips wins the game.
